**Directions and instructions**

The main entrance of the LUMC is 5 minutes walk from the Leiden Central Station (take the station exit towards LUMC, NOT towards the city center). When entering the main entrance of the LUMC, take the stairs/lift to the 1st floor and follow the hallway straight towards Collegezaal 3. Signs will be put in place to show the way.

Registration and coffee starts at 08h15, and the first talk starts at 09h00. Please don't be late!

Feel free to bring along notepads, laptops, or whatever makes you comfortable during talks.

Finally: we encourage all attendees to form part of the discussion, irrespective of your level of expertise, experience, gender, age, research field, or any other discerning factor. Ideas count, and OpenMR Benelux is a forum for us to discuss them!
